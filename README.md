SQL Server Data Analysis and Manipulation
This repository contains solutions to various SQL Server data analysis and manipulation tasks. Below are the summarized questions and answers:

Finding the Total Number of Rows in a Dataset: To count the total number of rows in a dataset, use an aggregate function to get the row count from the specified table.

Finding the Number of Distinct Months in a Dataset: To determine the number of distinct months, use the DATEPART function to extract the year and month from the date column and count the distinct combinations.

Calculating the Average of Multiple Columns: Calculate the average values of multiple columns (Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered) separately, and combine these averages if necessary for further analysis.

Handling Data Type Conversion Errors: When encountering data type conversion errors, such as converting varchar to float, use TRY_CAST or similar functions to safely attempt the conversion and handle errors gracefully.

Dropping a Column in SQL Server: To drop a column from a table, use the ALTER TABLE statement with the DROP COLUMN clause to remove the specified column.

Checking for Missing Values in the Entire Dataset: To check for missing values, examine each column individually for NULL values and count their occurrences to identify any gaps in the data.

Finding the Most Frequent Value for Each Column by Month: To find the most frequent values for Confirmed, Deaths, and Recovered each month, calculate the frequency of each value within each month and identify the most frequent (mode) values using ranking functions.

Setting the Compatibility Level of a Database: To set the compatibility level of a database, use the ALTER DATABASE statement to specify the desired compatibility level, ensuring that the database operates correctly under the set compatibility standards.

These solutions provide efficient methods for managing and analyzing data within SQL Server, addressing common challenges and enhancing data integrity and accuracy.
